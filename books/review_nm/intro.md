# Review of Numerical Methods and Probability

This section provides implementation for the concepts covered in the class for basic numerical
methods and probability. Each subsection describes the concept and contains various code blocks
which provide python implementation for the concept. You are expected to create an empty jupyter
notebook, and paste the code in the notebook and run it. This will teach you how to create 
notebooks from scratch and prepare you for workbook and homework assignments. Following topics are 
covered in this section:

1. Error estimation for iterative method  
2. Numerical Differentiation
3. Uniform distribution
4. Normal distribution
