# Local Optimization

This section provides implementation for concepts related to local optimization.
Each subsection contains various code blocks which provide python implementation for the concept. 
To fully understand the concepts, it will be helpful to create an empty jupyter notebook, and paste the code in the notebook and run it.
Following topics are covered in this section:

1. Unconstrained optimization
2. Constrained optimization
