# Local Optimization

This section provides implementation for the concepts covered in the class for local optimization.
Each subsection contains various code blocks which provide python implementation for the concept. 
You are expected to create an empty jupyter notebook, and paste the code in the notebook and run it. 
This will teach you how to create notebooks from scratch and prepare you for workbook and homework 
assignments. Following topics are covered in this section:

1. Unconstrained optimization
2. Constrained optimization
