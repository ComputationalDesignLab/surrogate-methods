# Sequential Sampling

This section provides implementation for the concepts covered in the class for sequential sampling, refer lecture notes for more details. Following methods are covered:

1. Exploitation
2. Exploration
3. Lower Confidence Bound (LCB)
4. Probability of Improvement (PI)

All the above methods are demonstrated using gaussian process model on forrester function which is given as:

$$
    f(x) = (6x-2)^2 \sin(12x-4)
$$
