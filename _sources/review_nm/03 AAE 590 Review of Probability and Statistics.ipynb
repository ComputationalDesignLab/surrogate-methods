    "Contours depict the samples drawn from the distribution, top distribution shows $x$ samples and side distribution shows $y$ samples. Notice that as you increase the number of samples both the distributions approach theortical normal distribution around respective mean, contour plot becomes elliptical in shape, and the center of the contour plot approaches ($\\mu_x$, $\\mu_y$). Also, since the $\\rho$ is negative, the elliptical contour is tilted i.e. as $x$ value increases $y$ value decreases and vice versa. You can change the value of $\\mu_x$, $\\sigma_x$, $\\mu_y$, $\\sigma_y$, $\\rho$, and see how the plots and probability answers change."
