# Review of Numerical Methods and Probability

This section provides implementation for the concepts related to basic numerical methods and probability. Each subsection describes the concept and contains various code blocks which provide python implementation for the concept. To fully understand the concepts, it will be helpful to create an empty jupyter notebook, and paste the code in the notebook and run it. Following topics are covered in this section:

1. Error estimation for iterative method  
2. Numerical Differentiation
3. Uniform distribution
4. Normal distribution
